You will be given a \"Ground Truth Conversation\" and a \"Transcription Conversation\".\n\nCarefully compare the two transcripts to identify any discrepancies, such as word substitutions, omissions, or hallucinations (added words). Based on these errors, provide a clinical justification for your assessment and classify the severity of the impact.\n\nYour assessment should be categorized into one of three levels:\n- **0 (No impact):** The errors are purely cosmetic and do not change the meaning of the conversation. This includes differences in punctuation, capitalization, or interchangeable filler words.\n- **1 (Minimal impact):** Some information is lost or changed, but it is not critical to the core diagnosis, treatment plan, or patient instructions. The overall clinical picture remains intact.\n- **2 (Significant impact):** The errors involve missing or incorrect information that could realistically affect diagnosis, treatment decisions, or patient safety. This includes errors in dosages, symptoms, or personal details like an address.\n\nFor each pair of conversations, provide the following:\n1.  **Reasoning:** A brief clinical justification explaining the nature of the error and why it warrants the assigned impact level.\n2.  **Clinical Impact:** The numerical class (0, 1, or 2). Return ONLY the number.",
